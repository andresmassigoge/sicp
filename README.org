* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

In conjunction with the Triangle Developers group, I am working through the
[[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html][SICP book]].

This repository contains my solutions to the various exercises.

Note that while this book is written for Scheme, my solutions may actually be
implemented in Clojure.
